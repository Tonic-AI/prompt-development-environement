# Better Prompt 🚀💻

## 🔬 Welcome to the Future of AI Prompt Engineering!

Welcome to **Better Prompt**, the cutting-edge Prompt Development Environment (PDE) that’s set to transform AI prompt engineering. This README serves as your guide to joining our mission to create a more intuitive and powerful platform for AI interactions.

### 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Prompt Sandbox:** Experiment with prompts in real-time, with instant feedback.
- **Community-Powered Libraries:** Access and contribute to a growing database of prompts for various AI models.
- **Collaborative Tools:** Pair programming, code reviews, and more - all in one place.
- **Extensive Documentation:** From getting started guides to advanced usage, we've got you covered.

### 🌟 Project Vision

Better Prompt is a greenlight project under active development. Our goal is to create an open-source, collaborative environment where developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts can come together to craft, test, and share AI prompts. With your help, we aim to build a suite of tools that will make prompt engineering more accessible and efficient.

### 🛠️ Action Plan

The first mechanics to implement in the app are:

1. Interactive Prompt Sandbox: A real-time testing ground for prompts.
2. Community-Powered Libraries: A repository for users to access and contribute prompts.
3. Collaborative Tools: Features like pair programming and code reviews.
4. Extensive Documentation: Comprehensive guides for users of all levels.

### 📝 Mechanics Implementation

To implement these mechanics, we’ll need to:

1. Develop a frontend interface for the Interactive Prompt Sandbox.
2. Set up a backend server to handle prompt storage and retrieval.
3. Create collaboration endpoints for real-time editing and feedback.
4. Write documentation that covers both basic and advanced use cases.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To contribute to Better Prompt, start by setting up your development environment:
